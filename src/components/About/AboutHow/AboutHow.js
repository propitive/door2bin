        There’s a reason the industry calls it “valet” trash. It’s because Valet
        Living sets the standard for how to do it right. Valet Living
        communities receive doorstep collection of trash and recycling five
        nights a week. We also offer customized days and times to fit your
        community’s specific needs.
